Welcome to melodious code; you made it, I’m slightly surprised.

Melodious Code isn’t much of a site yet; it will hopefully become an interesting little blog about being a developer and all that it entails (stories from the workplace, coder gripes, random posts on code related subjects, etc). Or it might not; it really depends on the coder’s ability to focus beyond his current projects!

Thanks for visiting and come back soon, there might even be something interesting to read!

Bored? Want more? Try visiting someone who actually writes some decent content!
