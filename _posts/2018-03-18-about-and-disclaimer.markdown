Melodious Code is the personal blog of a software developer from the United Kingdom (we don’t all live in silicone valley). Posts are likely to be related to software development or technology in general. Posts will be as regular or irregular as they are, no promises are made.

## Verification
You can locate me on [keybase](https://keybase.io/melodiouscode) and view my verified identities: https://keybase.io/melodiouscode.

## Cookies
You can read about cookies and my use of them over on our [cookie page](https://melodiouscode.net/why-cookies/).

## Analytics
I use Google Analytics to see if anyone actually visits this website; I have set their data retention settings to the lowest levels possible (so they delete analytic data as quickly as possible). All demographic info settings have been disabled; so that as little information as possible is collected.

## Statement Of Neutrality, Alignment And Interests
I work as a software developer (.NET, SQL, etc) for a UK based IT Services company; this website is separated from my professional activities. Should any article relate to the business of a firm I am directly attached to it is not to be taken as their word or opinion; everything I write is my opinion and mine only (unless otherwise marked on the article). Should I write an article on behalf of another firm it will be listed here for the purposes of disclosure:
###Sponsored or requested articles
None at this time

### Commercial Interests
I do not directly hold commercial interest in any technology firm (other than by my employment as a software developer, but I do not write directly about my firm unless obviously indicated). I do not directly hold any stocks or shares in a technology firm (I may via my pension fund, but that is not under my control). In the event that I am provided with a product or service to write about this will be clearly indicated in the article.

### Relationship to Employer
My personal activities; be they blogs, articles, social media posts, or otherwise are entirely my own. No posts/etc are approved by my employer (unless clearly marked as such), past or present. All statements and views expressed are my own.
