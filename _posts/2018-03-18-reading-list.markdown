Over the years we all collate a list of sites/blogs/etc that we keep an eye on (or that form our morning coffee reading list); personally I used to use Google Reader to aggregate all my rss feeds. Unfortunately Google decided for some unknown reason to shut it down; since then I have been using “the older reader” to group together my feeds; it is perfect!

Out of my morning coffee link list I feel these are worth visiting, reading, and subscribing with, you may or may not agree (but isn’t that the joy of the internet?):
