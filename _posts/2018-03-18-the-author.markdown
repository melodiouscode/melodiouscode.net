My name is James and I am a software developer and systems architect from the UK; I specialise in line of business applications for a range of industries (Valuations, Business Services, Legal, Insurance, Healthcare, etc). My core language is c# as a .NET developer; I also work with a range of web development languages and desktop frameworks (such as WPF, winforms, and silverlight etc). I also have substantial experience in the development and management of SQL Server.
