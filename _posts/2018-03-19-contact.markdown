There are a number of ways that you can contact me; if you feel the need!
## Email
You can mail me via james@melodiouscode.net; I don't promise to reply to every email (life can be busy) but I will do my best. See the end of this page for a list of things **I will** and **will not** reply to.

## Twitter
I have been active on twitter using [@melodiouscode](https://twitter.com/melodiouscode) for a number of years.

## Facebook
No, just no.

## What I will definatly reply to
Cool things, potential meetups, and comments about articles that just dont fit into the comment section.

## What I will definatly not reply to
* No I don't want your web design firm to re-design melodiouscode.net.
* No I won't just link to your article; if it's really cool then I might but not just becase you asked.
* If your email doesn't really make sense, or doesn't require a response (ask questions they get answers).
