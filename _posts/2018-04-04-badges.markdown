Everyone loves a badge or a sticker don't they. There are so many websites which display a Trusted/Verified logo like these:

Those in the know are more than aware that these are easy to fake; and as such mean very little.

That being said everyone loves a badge! So here are a few that actually do matter and relate to melodiouscode.net. You can verify them all using the links provided!

## SSL Labs
[Verify Here](https://ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=melodiouscode.co.uk&latest)
SSL Labs verifies the level of transit security used by a website; the types of encryption available, the use of HSTS, etc.

## Securityheaders.io
[Verify Here](https://schd.io/5sZu)
[securityheaders.io](https://securityheaders.io) is a service run by [Scott Helme](https://scotthelme.co.uk/) which checks other important security features such as CSP, XSS protection, etc.

## Mozilla Observatory
[Verify Here](https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze/melodiouscode.net)
The Mozilla Observatory works in much the same was as [securityheaders.io](https://securityheaders.io) but goes into a bit more depth in some places.

## HSTS Preload
[Verify Here](https://hstspreload.org/?domain=melodiouscode.net)
You can read about HSTS and the PreLoad directive in my '[HTTPS is just the tip of the sword](https://melodiouscode.net/https-is-just-the-tip-of-the-sword/)' article.
