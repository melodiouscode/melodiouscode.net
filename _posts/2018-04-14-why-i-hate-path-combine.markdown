As most .NET developers will know there is a Path.Combine() method in System.IO which can be used to (you guessed it) combine two file paths. Unfortunately, it sucks; it sucks bad.

<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/images/content/examples-min.png" class="kg-image" alt="some examples of Path.Combine use"></figure>

As you can see it functions just as you would expect in the first three lines; but it sucks on the last three. Why would Microsoft not implement a path separator check; adding or removing the separator where applicable? A very good question in my opinion; so I have my own implementation.

    using System;
    using System.IO;
    using System.Linq;
    
    public static class Pathy {
    	public static string Combine(string path1, params string[] paths) {
    		return paths.Aggregate(path1, Combine);
    	}
    	
    	private static string Combine(string path, string path2) {
    		char spliter = Path.DirectorySeparatorChar;
    		
    		if (path == null) {
    			throw new ArgumentException("Base path can not be null", nameof(path));
    		}
    		
    		if (path2 == null) {
    			throw new ArgumentException("Sub path can not be null", nameof(path2));
    		}
    		
    		path = path.Trim().TrimEnd(spliter);
    		path += spliter;
    		path += path2.Trim().TrimStart(spliter);
    		
    		return path;
    	}
    }

Pathy.Combine() takes two or more paths in the same way that Path.Combine() does and correctly merges them based on the default Path.DirecotrySeperatorChar as used by the current environment.
