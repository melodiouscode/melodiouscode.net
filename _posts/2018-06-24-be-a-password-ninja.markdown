Our dog, Daisy the West Highland White Terrier, decided she desperately needed a pee at 5:50 am on Saturday; and the weekend makes it my turn to get up with her! After dealing with her needs and turning on the coffee machine I didn't fancy picking up the project I have been working on and decided to try something new.

I needed a link for the password reset and password change pages of the project I am working on. I wanted to present the user with some simple to understand advice on how to pick a good password; don't get me wrong there are some great resources out there but none of the ones I came across was simple enough for what I wanted. Being the over the top domain name owner that I am (seriously I have a problem) I went and bought some more.
 
On Saturday morning I wrote a simple one-page website that is now hosted on [be-a-password.ninja](https://be-a-password.ninja) (and [beapassword.ninja](https://beapassword.ninja) just for completeness sake). It is a work in progress and just a simple site for the moment, as brain power and time allows it will become more detailed and hopefully more useful to the world. But for now, go and become a password ninja!

If anyone has any suggestions or comments (make them constructive) please leave a comment here!

And for those who don't know, this is Daisy!
