Meet Fred (that's what I'm calling him); he was sat at the back of his cage at [Bristol Zoo Gardens](https://www.bristolzoo.org.uk/) when I went to take a photograph of him. He spotted my camera and decided he wanted a better look, in the process of examining my camera he struck a pose for me!

Fred is a Brown Spider Monkey who lives in the Monkey Jungle at Bristol Zoo. The Brown Spider Monkey is critically endangered which is the step before being extinct in the wild. They are extremely charismatic and have very strong personalities, they live in small units of two males and two females. If you are from Bristol I strongly recommend taking a trip to Bristol Zoo to visit not only Fred but all his animal brethren.
